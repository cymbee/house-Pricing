# house-Pricing
A house pricing prediction using different AI  models 

This project compares various regression models that were applied to a housing dataset to forecast price changes.

For this project, python programming Language was used on Google Collab to analyse and create different regression models to predict the house prices in the provided dataset. This trained dataset has 3000 rows and 12 columns while test dataset has 999 rows and 12 columns. The features in both housing dataset included room, bathroom, kitchen, French door, backyard, furnished, green paint, solar power, wood floor, qlm security, and club access. Using a multiple linear regression, Random forest, and Knn Regression, the price (target) with assumed unit pounds will be predicted.

In conclusion, these findings show that there is a reasonable relationship between the dependent variable (price)(target) and the independent variables (room, furnished, wood floor, solar power, club access, backyard, kitchen, French door, qlm-security, green paint, and bathroom) through the correlation matrix, regression models applied (multiple linear regression and random forest).
It also implies that both regression models are reliable tools to predict the price since the R-Squared values are (Multiple linear regression: 1 and Random Forest: 0.9872).
Finally, the feature importance identified the room variable as the most importance feature in the Random forest model.
